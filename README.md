#This code only works for the older version of COC which is not usable anymore
Sorry, i am not interesting developing anymore


# COC-Automation
A python program that can play Clash Of Clans on its own

# Disclaimer:
This project is only for education purpose only
I am not promoting any game automation programs
I am not using this program to play the Clash Of Clans game

# Thing to do in the first boot of the program
-> For this program, you need to install BlueStack Android Emulator, not any other emulators and set the screev refreshing rate to 10 or 20 Hz.
-> Set the Emulator resolution to 2560 Ã— 1440
-> Install Clash Of Clans and log in your id or create a new id
-> The minimum required Town Hall is 5. If the TH is below 5 it won't work
-> Complete the construction of spell factory and unlock wizards in the barracks
-> In the Laboratory, at the first boot of this program, make sure the laboratory is free with all troops upgradable
-> Make sure the army camp is full 
-> The only allowed troop in army camp is Baloons and wizards

Still many thing to do for the first boot and this program will work without any error when all the requirements are attained
